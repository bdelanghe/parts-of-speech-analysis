# Parts of Speech Classifier 😄📚

Welcome to the world of language analysis! This project includes a fun, user-friendly webpage that takes in raw text and outputs a nifty list of words used, neatly categorized according to their Penn Treebank Part-of-Speech Tags. 🎯🗂️

Our classifier is crafted in JavaScript and dances with two significant libraries: p5.js and RitaJS, forming a beautiful ballet of technology and linguistics. 🎭💻

## Libraries in Action 🛠️🎉

### p5.js

p5.js is a JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. It allows you to create graphical and interactive experiences right in your web browser. With p5.js, the boring old static web page is transformed into a vibrant canvas teeming with creativity! 🖌️🌈

In our project, p5.js powers the graphical representation of word classification, adding a splash of fun and color to your parts-of-speech analysis journey. 🎨🎠

### RitaJS

RitaJS, developed by Daniel C. Howe, is a library for generative language tasks. It's like the magic spellbook for creative text projects! 🧙‍♂️📜 

RitaJS equips our classifier with the power to analyze and categorize words by their part-of-speech (POS) tags, making it easier for you to explore and understand the complex structure of English texts. 🕵️‍♂️📘

## Project Structure 🏗️

Here's a quick tour around our project's building blocks:

- `WordFreq`: This directory houses the code detective that deciphers word frequencies and ranks in your text.
- `libraries`: Our treasure chest of libraries, including the stars of the show, p5.js and RitaJS. 📚💎
- `commonwords.js`: This file is our handy little guidebook of common English words used for filtering and sorting through your text. 
- `posAnalyze.html`: The charming interface where you meet our POS classifier. This HTML file serves as the heart of the user experience.
- `sketchClass.js`: This JavaScript file is the paintbrush that draws and organizes the words based on their POS tags.
- `style.css`: The wardrobe of our `posAnalyze.html`, containing all the fabulous styles it flaunts.
- `war_and_peace.rtf`: The epic tale of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy in rich-text format, brought to you by Robert DeLanghe for testing and development. 🎭📖

## Let's Get Started! 🚀

1. Copy our project's repository to your local machine.
2. Launch `posAnalyze.html` in your favorite web browser.
3. Paste your text into the text area and hit the 'Analyze' button.
4. Sit back, relax, and watch the magic unfold as our tool organizes your text into colorful POS classifications!
